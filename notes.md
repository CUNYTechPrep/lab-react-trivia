This is notes for what I need to do for the lab

Add an event handler for the Next Question button - the answerbutton.jsx file

Fetch a new question for the app when the user clicks the Next Question button
use this API URL: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=1&category=9&type=multiple
the API will return a random question with each call
